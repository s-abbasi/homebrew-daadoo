# Homebrew cask for the Daadoo desktop agent. Generated: the template is
# apps/local-agent/packaging/homebrew/Casks/daadoo.rb in s-abbasi/daadoo-app,
# and s-abbasi/homebrew-daadoo's release workflow fills in version and sha256
# and commits it there as Casks/daadoo.rb. Edit the template, not the tap copy.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Daadoo drives your installed Google Chrome, so Chrome must be installed:
      brew install --cask google-chrome

    Daadoo is not notarized by Apple. This cask removes the download
    quarantine flag so it opens without a Gatekeeper prompt.
